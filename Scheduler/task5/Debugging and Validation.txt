# FreeRTOS Debug Notes — Time Slicing with Equal Priority Tasks

**FreeRTOSConfig.h**
- `#define configUSE_PREEMPTION        1`
- `#define configUSE_TIME_SLICING     1`

**Debug Setup**
- `break TaskA`
- `break TaskB`

**Execution**
- `continue`

**Breakpoint Sequence Observed**
- Breakpoint hit at **TaskA**
- Breakpoint hit at **TaskB**
- Breakpoint hit at **TaskA**
- Breakpoint hit at **TaskB**

**Observation**
- Both tasks are running
- CPU is being shared
- **Time slicing is active**

**Kernel Behavior at Each SysTick**
- Kernel checks **READY** tasks at the current priority
- Multiple tasks exist at the **same priority**
- Current task is moved to the **end of the Ready list**
- Next task in the Ready list is selected
- **PendSV** performs the context switch
