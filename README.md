Learning FreeRTOS on ARM Cortex-M from reset to scheduler, with hands-on debugging using QEMU and GDB.

# FreeRTOS on ARM Cortex-M (Learning Repository)

This repository documents a step-by-step, low-level exploration of
FreeRTOS on ARM Cortex-M using QEMU and GDB.

The focus is on understanding what actually happens at runtime:
startup code, linker scripts, scheduler initialization, context
switching, task control blocks, and RTOS timing — not just API usage.


> Note: This repository is a learning and exploration project,
> not production firmware.
